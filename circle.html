      <p>August 2018, saw the greatest flood in south Indian state of Kerala, due to unusually high rainfall in monsoon season. Over 483 people died, 14 are missing and at least a million people were evacuated. The event was declared a level 3 calamity by Indian government.
</p>
      <p>In the evening of 8th August, Kerala received heavy monsoon rainfall which was 256% more than the usual rainfall it receives. 35 out of 54 dams were opened as the water went close to the overflow level over a short period of next few days.

      <p>Could the sudden release of huge quantities of water from different dams, be the reason behind the catastrophe? In the article "Kerala floods: Poor dam management behind disasters, experts say" published on Hindustan times, Chetan Chauhan points out the different opinions expressed.</p>
      <p>According to water experts, the flood could have been reduced if water from 35 dams were released earlier.The CAG report says that there is an emergency plan for only 7% of the dams in india, with Kerala having none.

      Most of the power generating dams are not willing to reduce water level beyond a limit as it helps in power generation. Which can be true based on the fact that the level of water is directly related to the Power generation.
        </p>
      <p class="well">The height of the water behind the dam is the relevant height for the potential energy calculation, even if a given parcel of water is collected at the bottom of the dam. This is because the pressure of the water above provides the motive force. In the absence of turbines or other restrictions, the water would emerge from the penstock at a velocity of v = sqrt(2gh) so that a flow, F, would require an area A = F/v. </p>

      <p>According to AK Gosain, dam management in india works on the principle that at the end of the monsoon the reservoirs will be full. Hence are checked only then. However, only Bihar and Odisha of the 17 flood-prone states of India, have started checking their dams before and after monsoon in recent years.

      <p>As per the data from IMD, the warnings were issued 6 times, on 2nd, 6th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th August. Did the state of Kerala miss out on acting to those warnings?
      </p>
      <p>"Experts say the flooding in downstream areas can be better managed if the India Meteorological Department's 72-hour forecast is used to create simulation models for water release. Gujarat and Odisha governments use the IMD's forecast to release water slowing from the dams on Tapi and Mahanadi rivers respectively, helping the two states manage floods. Despite Gujarat receiving substantial rainfall in 2017, Surat city on the Tapi river was not flooded."- Source
